# WMC-Project---MATLAB-simulation-of-RSS-based-channel-modelling-localization-and-tracking
This is the project for course Wireless Mobile Communication.

Wireless communication has evolved significantly, over the past several decades, to meet the ever-growing demand for high data rates over the wireless medium. Systems have been designed for indoor applications and outdoor applications where mobility is a very important aspect of system specification.Â The propagation model for the wireless channel is characterized by path loss, multipath fading and Doppler spread (or Doppler spectrum). All these characteristics are affected by the physical environment between the transmitter and receiver as well as system dependent parameters such as antenna heights, antenna beam-widths, antenna polarization, and mutual coupling between multiple antennas.This project presents a MATLAB simulation of RSS based channel modelling , localization and tracking. Many factors have to be considered when RSS-based localization applications are designed, starting from selection of the proper propagation model, which has to represent in a relatively accurate way the interaction between the RF signal and the environment. It is demonstrated that the RSS can be used for outdoor localization.
